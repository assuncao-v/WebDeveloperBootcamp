        The <b>chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a domesticated <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a>
        species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
        junglefowl <sup>[1]</sup> that are originally from Southeastern Asia. <b>Rooster</b> or
        <b>cock</b> is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be
        called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult
        female bird is called a <b>hen</b> and a sexually immature female is
        called a <b>pullet</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally raised for cockfighting during the 500 B.C time frame in China
        according to estimations in the study of the sub-haplogroup C1, or for
        special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic
        period (4th-2nd centuries BC).Humans now keep chickens primarily as a
        source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with
        a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19
        billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
        There are numerous cultural references to chickens - in myth, folklore and
        religion, and in language and literature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of
        within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in
        the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the
        Indian subcontinent.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        An adult male is a called a <i>cock</i> or (in the United States) a
        <i>rooster</i> and an adult female is called a <i>hen</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Other terms are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Biddy</i>: a newly hatched chicken</li>
        <li><i>Capon</i>: a castrated or neutered male chicken</li>
        <li><i>Chick</i>: a young chicken</li>
        <li><i>Chook /tʃʊk/</i>: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)</li>
        <li><i>Cockerel</i>:a young male chicken less than a year old</li>
        <li>
          <i>Dunghill fowl</i>:a chicken with mixed parentage from different
          domestic varieties.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Pullet</i>: a young female chicken less than a year old. In the
          poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22
          weeks of age.
        </li>
        <li><i>Yardbird</i>: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young,
        bird. In older sources, chicken as a species were typically referred to as
        common fowl or domestic fowl.
      </p>
      <p>Chicken may also mean a chick.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Etymology</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird)
        originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the
        sexual connotation of the original English cock,and is widely used
        throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to
        sleep at night.
      </p>
      <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Chickens are omnivores. In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to
        search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small
        snakes, or sometimes young mice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The average chicken may live for 5-10 years, depending on the breed. The
        world's oldest known chicken lived 16 years according to Guinness World
        Records.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage
        of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks
        ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder
        colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds,
        such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck
        feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by
        looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the
        male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female
        chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy
        crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of
        skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and
        other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles.
        Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds
        these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found
        in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the
        chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard
      </p>
      <p>
        Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although
        lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances, such
        as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens
        may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally
        do so only to flee perceived danger.
      </p>
      <h3>Behavior</h3>
      <h4>Social Behavior</h4>
      <p>
        Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
        communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
        Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
        'pecking order', with dominant individuals having priority for food access
        and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a
        temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is
        established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock
        can lead to fighting and injury.
      </p>
      <h4>Vocalizations</h4>
      <p>
        When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He
        does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping
        the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their
        chicks and encourage them to eat.
      </p>
      <p>
        A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a
        territorial signal to other roosters. However, roosters may also crow in
        response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks.
        Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator
        approaching from the air or on the ground.
      </p>
      <h4>Crowing</h4>
      <i>"Cockadoodledoo" and "Cocka-doodle-doo" redirect here. For the nursery
        rhyme, see Cock a doodle doo.</i>
      <p>
        Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although
        it is possible for a hen to crow as well, crowing (together with hackles
        development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.
      </p>
      <h4>Rooster crowing contests</h4>
      <p>
        Rooster crowing contests, also known as crowing contests, are a
        traditional sport in several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands,
        Belgium, the United States, Indonesia and Japan. The oldest contests are
        held with longcrowers. Depending on the breed, either the duration of the
        crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain time is measured.
      </p>
      <h4>Courtship</h4>
      <p>
        To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a
        hen (a 'circle dance'), often lowering the wing which is closest to the
        hen. The dance triggers a response in the hen and when she responds to his
        'call', the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.
      </p>
      <p>More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Male approaching the hen</li>
        <li>Male pre-copulatory waltzing</li>
        <li>Male waltzing</li>
        <li>
          Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away
          (if unwilling to copulate)
        </li>
        <li>Male mounting</li>
        <li>Male treading with both feet on hen's back</li>
        <li>Male tail bending (following successful copulation)[42]</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Nesting and laying behaviour</h4>
      <p>
        Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have
        been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own. The result
        of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations,
        rather than having a different nest for every bird. Hens will often
        express a preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for
        two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the
        nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may
        result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other. There is evidence
        that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.
      </p>
      <h4>Broodiness</h4>
      <p>
        Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete,
        and they will then incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to "go
        broody". The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the
        incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs). She will
        sit or 'set' on the nest, fluffing up or pecking in defense if disturbed
        or removed. The hen will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or
        dust-bathe.While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant
        temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the
        first part of the incubation. To stimulate broodiness, owners may place
        several artificial eggs in the nest. To discourage it, they may place the
        hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breeds artificially developed for egg production rarely go broody, and
        those that do often stop part-way through the incubation. However, other
        breeds, such as the Cochin, Cornish and Silkie, do regularly go broody,
        and make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those
        of other species — even those with much smaller or larger eggs and
        different incubation periods, such as quail, pheasants, ducks, turkeys, or
        geese.
      </p>
      <h4>Hatching and early life</h4>
      <p>
        Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21
        days. Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all
        chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid
        over a period of two weeks or so. Before hatching, the hen can hear the
        chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to
        break out of their shells. The chick begins by 'pipping'; pecking a
        breathing hole with its egg tooth towards the blunt end of the egg,
        usually on the upper side. The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing
        the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane
        beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell). The
        chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and
        eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid.
        The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet down dries out in
        the warmth of the nest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick
        hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing
        the internal yolk sac. Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs,
        which can become habitual. Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood
        them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the
        nest at night. She leads them to food and water and will call them toward
        edible items, but seldom feeds them directly. She continues to care for
        them until they are several weeks old.
      </p>
      <h4>Defensive behaviour</h4>
      <p>
        Chickens may occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator. At
        least one credible report exists of a young fox killed by hens. A group of
        hens have been recorded in attacking a hawk that had entered their coop.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a chicken is threatened by predators, stress, or is sick, there is a
        chance that they will puff up their feathers.
      </p>
      <h3>Reproduction</h3>
      <p>
        Sperm transfer occurs by cloacal contact between the male and female, in a
        maneuver known as the 'cloacal kiss'. As with birds in general,
        reproduction is controlled by a neuroendocrine system, the
        Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone-I neurons in the hypothalamus. Locally to
        the reproductive system itself, reproductive hormones such as estrogen,
        progesterone, gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating
        hormone) initiate and maintain sexual maturation changes. Over time there
        is reproductive decline, thought to be due to GnRH-I-N decline. Because
        there is significant inter-individual variability in egg-producing
        duration, it is believed to be possible to breed for further extended
        useful lifetime in egg-layers.
