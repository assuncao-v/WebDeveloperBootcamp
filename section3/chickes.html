    The <b>chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a domesticated <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">junglefowl</a>
    species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
    junglefowlthat are originally from Southeastern Asia. <b>Rooster</b> or
    <b>cock</b> is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be
    called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult
    female bird is called a <b>hen</b> and a sexually immature female is
    called a <b>pullet</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originally raised for cockfighting during the 500 B.C time frame in China
      according to estimations in the study of the sub-haplogroup C1, or for
      special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic
      period (4th–2nd centuries BC).Humans now keep chickens primarily as a
      source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with
      a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19
      billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
      There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and
      religion, and in language and literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of
      within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in
      the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the
      Indian subcontinent.
    </p>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      An adult male is a called a <i>cock</i> or (in the United States) a
      <i>rooster</i> and an adult female is called a <i>hen</i>.
    </p>
    <p>Other terms are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Biddy</i>: a newly hatched chicken</li>
      <li><i>Capon</i>: a castrated or neutered male chicken</li>
      <li><i>Chick</i>: a young chicken</li>
      <li><i>Chook /tʃʊk/</i>: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)</li>
      <li><i>Cockerel</i>:a young male chicken less than a year old</li>
      <li>
        <i>Dunghill fowl</i>:a chicken with mixed parentage from different
        domestic varieties.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Pullet</i>: a young female chicken less than a year old. In the
        poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22
        weeks of age.
      </li>
      <li><i>Yardbird</i>: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young,
      bird. In older sources, chicken as a species were typically referred to as
      common fowl or domestic fowl.
    </p>
    <p>Chicken may also mean a chick.</p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird)
      originated in the mid- or late 18th century as a euphemism to avoid the
      sexual connotation of the original English cock,and is widely used
      throughout North America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to
      sleep at night.
    </p>
    <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Chickens are omnivores. In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to
      search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small
      snakes, or sometimes young mice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed. The
      world's oldest known chicken lived 16 years according to Guinness World
      Records.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage
      of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks
      ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder
      colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds,
      such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck
      feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by
      looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the
      male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female
      chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy
      crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of
      skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and
      other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles.
      Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds
      these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found
      in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the
      chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard
    </p>
    <p>
      Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although
      lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances, such
      as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens
      may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally
      do so only to flee perceived danger.
    </p>
    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <h4>Social Behavior</h4>
    <p>
      Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
      communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.
      Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a
      'pecking order', with dominant individuals having priority for food access
      and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a
      temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is
      established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock
      can lead to fighting and injury.
    </p>
    <h4>Vocalizations</h4>
    <p>
      When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He
      does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping
      the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their
      chicks and encourage them to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a
      territorial signal to other roosters. However, roosters may also crow in
      response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks.
      Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator
      approaching from the air or on the ground.
    </p>
    <h4>Crowing</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <i>"Cockadoodledoo" and "Cocka-doodle-doo" redirect here. For the nursery
        rhyme, see Cock a doodle doo.</i>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Roosters almost always start crowing before four months of age. Although
      it is possible for a hen to crow as well, crowing (together with hackles
      development) is one of the clearest signs of being a rooster.
    </p>
    <h4>Rooster crowing contests</h4>
    <p>
      Rooster crowing contests, also known as crowing contests, are a
      traditional sport in several countries, such as Germany, the Netherlands,
      Belgium, the United States, Indonesia and Japan. The oldest contests are
      held with longcrowers. Depending on the breed, either the duration of the
      crowing or the times the rooster crows within a certain time is measured.
    </p>
    <h4>Courtship</h4>
    <p>
      To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a
      hen (a 'circle dance'), often lowering the wing which is closest to the
      hen. The dance triggers a response in the hen and when she responds to his
      'call', the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.
    </p>
    <p>More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Male approaching the hen</li>
      <li>Male pre-copulatory waltzing</li>
      <li>Male waltzing</li>
      <li>
        Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away
        (if unwilling to copulate)
      </li>
      <li>Male mounting</li>
      <li>Male treading with both feet on hen's back</li>
      <li>Male tail bending (following successful copulation)[42]</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Nesting and laying behaviour</h4>
    <p>
      Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have
      been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own. The result
      of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations,
      rather than having a different nest for every bird. Hens will often
      express a preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for
      two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the
      nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may
      result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other. There is evidence
      that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.
    </p>
    <h4>Broodiness</h4>
    <p>
      Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete,
      and they will then incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to "go
      broody". The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the
      incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs). She will
      sit or 'set' on the nest, fluffing up or pecking in defense if disturbed
      or removed. The hen will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or
      dust-bathe.While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant
      temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the
      first part of the incubation. To stimulate broodiness, owners may place
      several artificial eggs in the nest. To discourage it, they may place the
      hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breeds artificially developed for egg production rarely go broody, and
      those that do often stop part-way through the incubation. However, other
      breeds, such as the Cochin, Cornish and Silkie, do regularly go broody,
      and make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those
      of other species — even those with much smaller or larger eggs and
      different incubation periods, such as quail, pheasants, ducks, turkeys, or
      geese.
    </p>
    <h4>Hatching and early life</h4>
    <p>
      Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21
      days. Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all
      chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid
      over a period of two weeks or so. Before hatching, the hen can hear the
      chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to
      break out of their shells. The chick begins by 'pipping'; pecking a
      breathing hole with its egg tooth towards the blunt end of the egg,
      usually on the upper side. The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing
      the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane
      beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell). The
      chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and
      eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid.
      The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet down dries out in
      the warmth of the nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick
      hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing
      the internal yolk sac. Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs,
      which can become habitual. Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood
      them when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the
      nest at night. She leads them to food and water and will call them toward
      edible items, but seldom feeds them directly. She continues to care for
      them until they are several weeks old.
    </p>
    <h4>Defensive behaviour</h4>
    <p>
      Chickens may occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator. At
      least one credible report exists of a young fox killed by hens. A group of
      hens have been recorded in attacking a hawk that had entered their coop.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a chicken is threatened by predators, stress, or is sick, there is a
      chance that they will puff up their feathers.
    </p>
    <h3>Reproduction</h3>
    <p>
      Sperm transfer occurs by cloacal contact between the male and female, in a
      maneuver known as the 'cloacal kiss'. As with birds in general,
      reproduction is controlled by a neuroendocrine system, the
      Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone-I neurons in the hypothalamus. Locally to
      the reproductive system itself, reproductive hormones such as estrogen,
      progesterone, gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating
      hormone) initiate and maintain sexual maturation changes. Over time there
      is reproductive decline, thought to be due to GnRH-I-N decline. Because
      there is significant inter-individual variability in egg-producing
      duration, it is believed to be possible to breed for further extended
      useful lifetime in egg-layers.
